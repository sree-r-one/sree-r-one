## 🧠 About Me

With a journey spanning **automotive systems**, **AR/VR**, **robotics**, and **full-stack development**, I thrive at the intersection of **design**, **performance**, and **scale**. Whether it's building microservices, automating infrastructure, or diving deep into embedded C++, I’m constantly evolving.

- 🎓 Started my **Master’s in Software Engineering at NUS** in **January 2025**  
- 🧠 Actively building through a **100 Days of C++** challenge and production-grade project work  
- 💻 Proficient in **Java**, **C++**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**  
- 🔁 From embedded Linux to scalable web apps and cloud-native DevOps pipelines  
- 🔍 If I haven’t mastered it yet, I’ve probably scheduled it for next week


## 🚀 Projects & Explorations

- ✈️ **Explore Singapore** – Microservices-based travel platform using **Node.js**, **FastAPI**, **Docker**, **NGINX**
- 🧠 **Automatic Post-Editing for Translation** – GPT-powered + TM-optimized APE system with XML workflows
- 🛍️ **TradePort** – University-grade **.NET** e-commerce app (microservice architecture, CI/CD ready)
- 🚗 **Smart Vehicle Telematics** – MISRA-compliant C++ modules for automotive Linux platforms
- 🤖 **ADAM Robotics Dashboard** – Real-time ROS visualizer with GitHub Actions + container-based pipelines
