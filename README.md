# Hi there, Sree here!

Software Engineer | Backend & DevOps Practitioner | Embedded Systems Explorer  
MTech in Software Engineering @ National University of Singapore  
Currently on sabbatical from Continental to deepen my technical foundation and complete my Master’s.

[![My Learning Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/card/tall/67e87c5d08b58aed6c960ad1?variant=light&roadmaps=api-design%2Ctypescript%2Cdevops%2Ccpp)](https://roadmap.sh)

## My Background

I started my career in manufacturing and testing at GLOBALFOUNDRIES, working closely with machine performance and yield optimization. Over time, I moved into system integration, DevOps, and eventually embedded C++ development at Continental, where I spent nearly 6 years across several roles.

In early 2025, I took a sabbatical to pursue a full-time Master’s in Software Engineering at NUS, with the aim of strengthening my backend, cloud, and architecture skills — and building end-to-end production-grade systems with intention and clarity.

This profile tracks that transition: from operational support to product-focused software engineering.

## Current Focus

- Building full-stack systems in a 100 Days of Fullstack challenge  
- Deep-diving into Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and REST APIs  
- Working with CI/CD pipelines, GitHub Actions, Docker, and Terraform  
- Learning AWS infrastructure hands-on (IAM, EC2, S3, VPC, Lambda)  
- Developing real-world apps using React + FastAPI

## 2025 Goals

- Complete my MTech in Software Engineering at NUS  
- Launch Explore Singapore and supporting backend services to production  
- Finish 100 Days of Fullstack with AWS deployment and system design  
- Build robust CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions, Terraform, and testing gates  
- Strengthen hands-on AWS skills (VPC, EC2, S3, Lambda, IAM)

## Collaboration

I'm open to collaboration on:

- Backend/API development (Java Spring Boot, Python, Node.js)  
- DevOps pipelines and deployment workflows  
- Embedded C++ projects on Linux platforms  
- Full-stack systems with React + containerized services

Feel free to reach out if you're working on something interesting or would like to exchange ideas.

## Closing Note

I'm steadily working to bring structure, reliability, and clarity into the systems I build. From debugging embedded logs to writing testable APIs, I enjoy engineering solutions that work — and evolve.
