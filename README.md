## 🧠 About Me

With a journey that spans **automotive systems**, **AR/VR**, **robotics**, and **full-stack development**, I thrive at the intersection of **design**, **performance**, and **scale**. Whether it's building microservices, automating infrastructure, or diving into low-level embedded C++, I’m constantly evolving and adapting.

- 🎓 Pursuing **Master’s in Software Engineering**, NUS  
- 💻 Experienced in **Java**, **C++**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**  
- 🔁 From embedded Linux to scalable web apps & DevOps pipelines  
- 🔍 If I haven’t mastered it yet, I’ve probably scheduled it for next week


## 🚀 Projects & Explorations

- ✈️ **Explore Singapore** – Microservices-based travel app using **Node.js**, **FastAPI**, **Express**, **Docker**, **NGINX**  
- 🤖 **ADAM Robotics Dashboard** – Real-time ROS data visualization & control with containerized CI/CD pipelines  
- 🛍️ **TradePort** – A university-grade **.NET** e-commerce app following microservice architecture  
- 🚗 **Smart Vehicle Telematics** – MISRA-compliant C++ for Linux-based automotive control systems  
- 🧠 **Automatic Post-Editing for Translation** – Leveraging **LLMs + Fuzzy TM** with structured prompts and XML workflows
