A Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable full-stack systems and robust DevOps pipelines. I am currently a full-time **MTech in Software Engineering** student at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**, taking a sabbatical to deepen my expertise in cloud architecture, system design, and modern backend technologies.



### My Journey: From Factory Floor to Full-Stack

My path to software engineering wasn't a straight line. It was a journey of exploration that began on the factory floor. I started my career working graveyard shifts as a technician in semiconductor manufacturing at **Globalfoundries**. Surrounded by some of the most complex and automated machinery in the world, I became fascinated with the intricate systems that made it all possible. This experience instilled in me a deep appreciation for how technology works at a fundamental level.

This curiosity led me on a serendipitous path through the automotive industry at **Continental**. I moved from testing embedded automotive components to broader roles in project management, machine vision, and even AR/VR development for industrial systems. Each role was a piece of a larger puzzle, giving me a unique, holistic view of the engineering lifecycle—from hardware testing and systems integration to the end-user experience.

Through this journey, I realized that my true passion was not just in using these systems, but in *building* them. I found my calling in embedded C++ and DevOps, where I could finally bridge the gap between physical hardware and scalable software. My background isn't just a list of jobs; it's the foundation of my engineering philosophy: to build with intention, clarity, and a deep understanding of the entire stack.

That is what led me to NUS. I took a sabbatical to pursue my Master's, not just to learn, but to deliberately strengthen my foundations in backend architecture and cloud-native systems. I'm here to synthesize years of hands-on experience with rigorous academic principles to become a more complete and effective engineer.



### 🚀 What I'm Currently Focused On

* **Building for Production:** Architecting and developing end-to-end applications, with a focus on clean, testable, and maintainable code.
* **Backend & APIs:** Deep-diving into **Java** and **Spring Boot** to build robust, scalable microservices and RESTful APIs.
* **DevOps & Automation:** Creating and managing CI/CD pipelines using **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Terraform** to automate everything from testing to deployment.
* **Cloud Infrastructure:** Gaining hands-on experience with **AWS** services (IAM, EC2, S3, VPC, Lambda) to build and deploy resilient, cloud-native solutions.
