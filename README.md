A Software Engineer focused on building scalable full-stack systems and robust DevOps pipelines. I am currently a full-time **MTech in Software Engineering** student at the **National University of Singapore (NUS)**, taking a sabbatical to deepen my expertise in cloud architecture and system design.

### My Journey

I started my career with hands-on hardware experience as a manufacturing technician at **Globalfoundries**. This work sparked my curiosity about the software that powers complex systems, leading me to the automotive industry at **Continental**.

My path wasn't linear. I intentionally moved through diverse roles—from testing embedded components to requirements engineering, machine vision, and AR/VR development. This journey gave me a unique, ground-up perspective on the entire engineering lifecycle.

I found my calling in building the systems themselves, which led me to specialize in embedded C++ and DevOps. To round out my practical experience with a stronger theoretical foundation in backend architecture, I am now pursuing my Master's at NUS.

### 🚀 What I'm Currently Focused On

  * **Building for Production:** Architecting and developing end-to-end applications with a focus on clean, testable, and maintainable code.
  * **Backend & APIs:** Deep-diving into **Java** and **Spring Boot** to build robust, scalable microservices and RESTful APIs.
  * **DevOps & Automation:** Creating CI/CD pipelines using **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Terraform** to automate testing and deployment.
  * **Cloud Infrastructure:** Gaining hands-on experience with **AWS** services (IAM, EC2, S3, VPC, Lambda) to build and deploy resilient solutions.
